# MERN Stack Learning/Practice Task

Welcome to my MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) Stack learning/practice repository! This repository contains the coding files and projects I've worked on as part of my journey to learn and practice MERN Stack development.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find a collection of directories organized by day, each containing coding exercises, projects, or notes related to my MERN Stack learning process. The structure of the repository is as follows:

- **DayX/**: Each day's directory contains the work done on that specific day.
    - **React/**: Contains React app projects and exercises.
    - **Node\_Express/**: Contains Node.js and Express.js tasks and projects.

## Getting Started

To explore the projects and exercises in this repository, simply navigate to the respective day's directory and then to the React or Node\_Express directory, depending on your interest.

### Prerequisites

To run the projects and exercises, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (for Node.js and Express.js projects)
- React.js (for React app projects)
- MongoDB (if any projects involve database interactions)
